# My Agile Pomodoro

myAgilePomodoro is a time management software that brings you the best of two worlds: Agile's most common practices and the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique&#174;</a>.

mAP can be used as a Agile software, a Pomodoro timer or a simple ToDo list.

mAP is a free open-source, GPLv3, Java 6+, 32/64-bit, utf-8, multilingual, standalone and portable application (no installer).

Although mAP implements all Pomodoro Technique®’s rules, it is flexible in many ways. For example, mAP adds two new rules to support sub-tasking. We suggest those rules to be added to the Pomodoro Technique®’s specification.

Features:
- Pomodoro: short / long breaks, interruptions / unplanned tasks, overestimations...
- Pomodoro: full implementation of the technique + Sub-tasking
- Import / Export: CSV, Excel 2003/18, XML, Google Drive
- Agile: backlog management, story points, iteration...
- Timer: ticking / ringing, mute, pause, resizing...
- Charts: burn-down / up, target, scope, guide
- Database: local SQLite / remote MySQL
- System tray: progress icon, messages
- Multilingual: English, French, Italian
- Look and feel: themes

Technical requirements:
- Oracle Java or Open JDK 6+
- Read/Write access to the local file system (a local database is created by mAP)
