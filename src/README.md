myAgilePomodoro is a time management software that brings you the best of two worlds: Agile's most common practices and the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique&#174;</a>. Hence mAP can be used as a Agile software, a Pomodoro timer or simply a ToDo list.

mAP is a free open-source, GPLv3, Java 6+, 32/64-bit, utf-8, multilingual, standalone and portable application (no installer).

mAP follows the Pomodoro Technique®’s rules, it is flexible in many ways.

mAP implements two new rules to support sub-tasking. We suggest those rules to be added to the Pomodoro Technique®’s specification.
